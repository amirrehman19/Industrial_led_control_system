# ðŸš¦ Industrial Web-Controlled LED Signal System

This project is designed to control industrial-grade red and green LED indicators using:
- âœ… Web-based relay switching via ESP32 (Ethernet)
- âœ… High-power LED driving circuit using Arduino Nano, MOSFETs, and LED drivers

The system is ideal for **industrial entrances** where visual signals (STOP/GO) are needed for traffic or worker flow control.
